# Tell me a joke

The sample in [main.py](main.py) defines two agents:
 * comedian
 * user_proxy

The `comedian` is configured to respond with jokes back to the user.

The chat is then initiate with an request for a joke with cats and ninjas from teh user, from that the `user_proxy` will have oppotunities to ask for more or terminate the session.

This code is a Python script that imports two classes, `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`, from a module called `autogen`. It also imports the `os`  module.

The code defines a list called `config_list`which contains a dictionary with configuration information for an agent. The dictionary includes values for the model, API key, API type, base URL, and API version. These values are retrieved from environment variables using the `os.environ.get()' function.

Next, an instance of the `AssistantAgent` class is created and assigned to the variable `comedian`. The `AssistantAgent` constructor is called with several arguments including the agent's name, system message, description, and a configuration list. The configuration list is passed as a keyword argument with the key `llm_config`.

Then, an instance of the `UserProxyAgent` class is created and assigned to the variable `user_proxy`. The `UserProxyAgent` constructor is called with the agent's name and a code execution configuration dictionary. The code execution configuration includes a working directory and a flag indicating whether to use Docker.

Finally, the `initiate_chat()` method is called on the `user_proxy` instance. This method takes two arguments: the `comedian` instance and a message string. It initiates a chat between the user proxy agent and the comedian agent, with the message "Tell me a joke about cats and ninjas."

Overall, this code sets up a conversation between a user proxy agent and a comedian agent, using configuration information and message input.
